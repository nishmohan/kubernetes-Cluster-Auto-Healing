# Kubernetes Cluster Health Checker and Auto-Healing

 ## Project Goal
 1. Develop an automated health monitoring system for Kubernetes clusters, focusing on key metrics like node health, pod statuses, and resource utilization.
 2. Implement self-healing actions that restart failed pods, reschedule workloads, and, if necessary, trigger scaling events to balance workloads.
 3. Provide real-time alerts and notifications to inform the team of critical issues that may require manual intervention.
 4. Create a web dashboard to display real-time health status, historical data, and auto-healing logs for transparency and traceability.
